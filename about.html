<p>My name is Joey Anh Huynh. I am in the second year Graphic Design program of Algonquin College. I was born in Vietnam, then I came to Canada when I was eighteen years old.Cooking is my passion and I take great pride in using only the freshesh ingredients in the preparation my authentic Vietnamese dishes. Recipes that have been handed down through generations.</p>
